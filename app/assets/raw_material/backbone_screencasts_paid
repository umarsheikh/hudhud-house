from http://railscasts.com/episodes/323-backbone-on-rails-part-1

- create rails app
- have an action, with a view with just an id, with the content loading... like so:
  %div{:id => "content"}
    Loading...
- make that the root path, u hit url, the page loads, showing the loading div, and then backbone takes over...
- use https://github.com/meleyal/backbone-on-rails
- as working on the hudhud-mongobo app, open the assets file app/assets/javascripts/hudhud_mongobo.js.coffee and look at it, to see the backbone objects namespace, initialization etc
- rails generate backbone:scaffold user
