sometimes you cannot even access a site, example http://www.maxpreps.com/contests/O5FuuzLmiky-byxZesiLlQ/basketball-winter-12-13/boxscore-massac-county-metropolis-vs-meridian-mounds.htm . Being in Pakistan, they disallow most probably anyone from Pakistan for accessing them.

But I need to access it in order to scrape information from it.

What is a proxy server?
from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server
a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers

Why do i need a proxy?
the destination server filters request based on origin of request, example ip-based geolocation, to restrict access to a country, can be accessed using a proxy located in that country to access the service

look at https://github.com/jianxioy/ruby-proxy/blob/master/proxy.rb
