%h2.heading-green Implementation of Common Patterns In Javascript

%h3.green Singleton Pattern (Literal Notation)
Instead of creating an object using the new keyword and a function call, you create an object using literal notation.
Since you don't now have to use the new keyword, this object is already initialized with the name you gave it. You can begin using it immediately. Usually we create them for the singleton pattern. Here is a reference example:
%br
%pre
  %code
    var apple = {
    \  type: "singhri",
    \    color: "red",
    \    getInfo: function () {
    \        return this.color + ' ' + this.type + ' apple';
    \    }
    }
    apple.color = "purple";
    alert(apple.getInfo());

%h3.green Singleton Pattern (Anonymous Function)
Again, this sytax is used to create an object you want only one instance of. This is also a way to create modules. It is pretty much the above with anonymous function syntax. You can use it to create one instance of an object, which is already initialzed when the function terminates, and you can begin using it.
%br
%pre
  %code
    var apple = new function(){
    \  this.type = "singhri";
    \  this.color = "red";
    \  this.getInfo = function(){
    \    return this.color + " " + this.type + " apple";
    \  };
    }
    apple.color = "purple";
    alert(apple.getInfo());

%h3.green Inheritance Pattern

Four-step process.
%br
%div.blue Step 1: define the base class
%pre
  %code
    function Person(){}
    Person.prototype.welcome = function(){alert("welcome to javascript 101");};
%br
%div.blue Step 2: define the sub class, and link to parent constructor
%pre
  %code
    function Worker(){
    \  Person.call(this);
    }
%br
%div.blue Step 3: inherit from the base class
%pre
  %code

    Worker.prototype = new Person();
%br
%div.blue Step 4: correct the constructor pointer
%pre
  %code
    Worker.prototype.constructor = Worker;

%h3.green Pseudo-Classical Inheritance Pattern
This is very similar to the above, in fact, pretty much another way to write the same thing. it uses a function for inheritance, declares the prototypes of different functions (which are made since class keyword is missing) using literal syntax, then corrects child constructor pointer just like above. I am writing this here just so that this common pattern is also easily recognized.

%div.blue Step 1: function for inheritance, and correct the child constructor pointer
%pre
  %code
    var extendObj = function(child, paren){
    \  var tmp = function(){}
    \  tmp.prototype = paren.prototype;
    \  child.prototype = new tmp();
    \  child.prototype.constructor = child;
    }
%div.blue Step 2: Create base class, and its prototype
%pre
  %code
    var Person = function(){};
    Person.prototype = {
    \  name: '',
    \  gender: '',
    \  occupation: '',
    \  greeter: function(){alert("I am " + this.name + " and I am a " + this.gender + "; I am a " + this.occupation);}
    }
%div.blue Step 3: Create sub classes
%pre
  %code
    var Carpenter = function(name){
    \  this.name = name;
    \  this.occupation = "carpenter";
    }
    var Plumber = function(name){
    \  this.name = name;
    \  this.occupation = "plumber";
    }
%div.blue Step 4: Link subclass to superclass
%pre
  %code
    extendObj(Carpenter, Person);
    extendObj(Plumber, Person);

%h3.green Functional Inheritance pattern 1
Some features of this functional inheritance pattern:
%ul
  %li you create objects without using the 'new' keyword
  %li the 'this' keyword is also missing
Base object creates an empty object, adds some properties and methods to it, and returns it. The child object uses this object and adds more methods and properties to it. (Since this happens to each object thus created, it is more expensive than the inheritance pattern using methods in the prototype property, which only executes once, just like in the classical pattern in other languages.)

%pre
  %code
    function Person(spec){ // alternate syntax: var Person = function(spec){
    \  var that = {};
    \  that.name = spec.name;
    \  that.gender = spec.gender || '';
    \  return that;
    }
    function Student(spec){ // alternate syntax: var Student = function(spec){
    \  var that = Person(spec);
    \  that.roll_number = spec.roll_number || 0;
    \  that.sayhello = function(){
    \    return "hello " + that.name;
    \  }
    \  return that;
    }

    var student = Student({name: "I am a functional object"});
    alert(student.sayhello());

%div.blue One advantage of the other approach is that the closures of the functions allow for good use of private methods and attributes.
%div Here is sample code:
%pre
  %code
    var vehicle = function(attrs){
    \  var _privateObj = {hasEngine: true},that = {};
    \  that.name = attrs.name;
    \  that.engineSize = attrs.engineSize;
    \  that.hasEngine = function(){return "this " + that.name + " has engine: " + _privateObj.hasEngine;};
    \  return that;
    }
    \
    var motorbike = function(){
    \  var _privateObj = {numWheels: 2},
    \  that = vehicle({name: "motorbike", engineSize: "Small"});
    \  that.totalNumWheels = function(){return "this bike " + that.name + " has " _privateObj.numwheels + " wheels";};
    \  that.increaseWheels = function(){_privateObj.numWheels++;};
    \  return that;
    }
    \
    var boat = function(){
    \  that = vehicle({name: 'boat', engineSize: 'large'});
    \  return that;
    }
    \
    myBoat = boat();
    myBoat.hasEngine();
    alert(myBoat.engineSize);
    myMotor = motorbike();
    myMotor.hasEngine();
    myMotor.increaseWheels();
    myMotor.totalNumWheels();
    alert(myMotor.engineSize);

%h3.green Anonymous Function Declaration
Create an anonymous function:
%pre
  %code
    function(){}
Execute it immediately:
%pre
  %code
    (function(){}());

%h3.green Pass Globals to Anonymous Function, Also Called Global Import
This technique is faster than having globals, since globals get aliased to local variables.
%pre
  %code
    (function($, YAHOO){...}(jQuery, YAHOO));

%h3.green The Basic Module Pattern
This basic pattern is much like the "Pass Globals to Anonymous Function, Also Called Global Import" Pattern. Except that instead of passing globals to the anonymous function, we want to create a global variable using the result of the anonymous function's return value.

%pre
  %code
    var MODULE = (function(){
    \  var that = {};
    \  that.some_property = true;
    \  ...
    \  return that;
    }());

%h3.green Module Augmentation Pattern
%pre
  %code
    var MODULE = (function(my){
    \  my.anothermethod = function(){};
    \  my.someotherprop = 12;
    \  return my;
    }(MODULE));
In the above example, the 'var' before MODULE is not needed, since it is also declared before.

%h3.green Loose Augmentation
Useful for multipart modules divided over many files, and where load order may be non deterministic.
%pre
  %code
    var MODULE = (function(my){
    \  my.anothermethod = function(){};
    \  my.someotherprop = 12;
    \  return my;
    }(MODULE || {}));

%h3.green Tight Augmentation
You can override/use properties/methods safely. Tight augmentation implies a set loading order, where you can override/use properties defined in other files.
%pre
  %code
    var MODULE = (function(my){
    \  var old_method = my.module_method;
    \  my.module_method = function(){
    \  // has access to old method through old_method, can override.
    };
    \  my.someotherprop = 12;
    \  return my;
    }(MODULE));

%h3.green Sub Module Pattern

%pre
  %code
    MODULE.sub = (function(){
    \  var my = {};
    \  //;
    \  return my;
    }());
%h3.green Cloning and Inheritance Pattern
%div
%pre
  %code

    var MODULE_TWO = (function(mod){
    \  var key, that = {};
    \  for(key in mod){
    \    if(mod.hasOwnProperty(key){
    \      that[key] = mod[key];
    \     }
    \   }
    \  var old_meth = mod.module_method;
    \  that.module_method = function(){
    \  // has access to parent's method through old_meth
    \   }
    \  //...
    \  return that;
    }(MODULE_1));
